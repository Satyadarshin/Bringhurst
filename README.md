# Bringhurst
A template project with a lean in to best-practice Web typography, inspired by Robert Brignhurst and his seminal *Elements of Typographic Style* (Hartley & Marks Publishers, 2012).

## SASS
A breakdown of the partials and what they collate. 
- Typography. Styles that are aimed at fonts
- Utilities. Multi-use classes that 

## Credit where credit's due

Almost all of the work you see in this project was collated from reading and watching articles and tutorials around the Web. As far as possible I've credited everyone who's work I've directly folded into the project.
